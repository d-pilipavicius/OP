# Platformer game
  ## A game I had to create as the first task

### Controls

  - Press E to edit whatever map you'd like.

### Block editor
  - To select a block, click on the red triangle at the top right corner.
  - To set a spawnpoint, select the stickman.
  - To select an eraser click on the red square.
  - The door is the winning end goal.


### EDITORS NOTE!

  This game is left a mess because of a change that was required to be made mid lecture.
